## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to implement a test suite for a web application that reads RSS feeds.  Given a pre-existing application, I implemented the test suite using [Jasmine] (http://jasmine.github.io).

## Technology Stack
- Jasmine -- a JavaScript testing framework
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

## Installation Instructions

First, clone the repository on your local machine. 

Start local web server

The tests are ran and then placed below the feed reader.
